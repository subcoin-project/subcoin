## Overview

Subcoin is a full node implementation of Bitcoin in Rust, built using the Substrate framework.
By leveraging Substrate's modular and flexible architecture, Subcoin aims to offer a robust
and performant implementation of Bitcoin protocol.

Currently, Subcoin only implements the feature of syncing as a full node. It is not yet capable
of participating in the Bitcoin consensus as a miner node. Additional features are in the
planning stages.

## Pros

- ðŸ”„ **Fast Sync**. Employs Substrate's advanced state sync strategy, enabling Bitcoin fast sync
by downloading all headers and the state at a specific block.
- ðŸ”— **Substrate Integration**: Utilizes Substrate framework provide production-level blockchain infrastructures.

## Disclaimer

**Do not use Subcoin in production.** It is a heavy work in progress, not feature-complete and the code
has not been audited as well. Use at your own risk.
