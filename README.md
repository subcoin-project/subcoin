## Overview

Subcoin is a full node implementation of Bitcoin in Rust, built using the [polkadot-sdk (formerly Substrate)](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk) framework.
By leveraging Substrate's modular and flexible architecture, Subcoin aims to offer a robust
and performant implementation of Bitcoin protocol. It is the first Bitcoin client that
introduces the decentralized fast sync into the Bitcoin ecosystem, a syncing strategy common
in newer blockchains (Ethereum, Polkadot, Near, etc) with a global chain state.

## Features

- ðŸ”„ **Fast Sync**. Employs Substrate's advanced state sync strategy, enabling Bitcoin fast sync
  by downloading all headers and the state at a specific block, in decentralized manner. This allows
  new users to quickly sync to the latest state of the Bitcoin chain by running a Subcoin node.

- ðŸ”— **Substrate Integration**. Utilizes Substrate framework to provide production-level blockchain infrastructures.

## Development Status

Subcoin currently includes a tentative implementation for syncing as a Bitcoin full node, along with an
early version of the fast sync feature. However, due to limitations, syncing to the tip of the Bitcoin
network using fast sync is not feasible when the chain state becomes large. We are actively exploring
solutions to address this limitation, which will be supported in future updates.

It's important to note that Subcoin is still under active development and is not yet stable. It also
does not yet support participation in Bitcoin consensus as a miner node. Additional features and
improvements are planned for future releases.

## Run Tests

```bash
cargo test --workspace --all
```

## Disclaimer

**Do not use Subcoin in production.** It is a heavy work in progress, not feature-complete and the code
has not been audited as well. Use at your own risk.
